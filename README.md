I have cleaned up the code in the following places:
    ~ fixed the Search Engine Optimatiaton link in the nav bar
    ~ added the group meeting image bellow the nav bar

I have updated the code to read more claerly for acsessablity in the folowing ways:
    ~ apliieyd semantic html tags where relivent
    ~ added coments to the html file to read more clearly as text
    ~ added image alt tags to explain images as text 
    ~ added coments to the css file to cliarfiy flow of styling 

And added this readme file :)
